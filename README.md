# FitKit: Fit functions to data

FitKit is a library to help with the easy fitting of 1 dimensional mathematical
functions (currently expressed using SymPy) to complex data, a problem that
commonly arises in scientific anlysis. FitKit provides a simple user interface
to `scipy.optimize` routines and also provides a GUI for manually tuning
model parameters.
